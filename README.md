## Project Overview

This project analyzes user behavior on an ecommerce platform. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help in improving the user experience, increasing conversion rates, and optimizing the overall performance of the ecommerce platform.

The analysis includes various stages such as data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning models to predict user actions like purchases, cart additions, and more.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathered from a public or private dataset containing ecommerce user interactions.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual and statistical analysis of user behavior.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features to improve model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predictive modeling to anticipate user actions.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of key findings.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/karanzaveri/Ecommerce-User-Behaviour.git
    cd Ecommerce-User-Behaviour
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can start exploring the project:

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Open the Jupyter notebook `EDA.ipynb` to explore the data and gain insights.

2. **Running Models**:
   - Use `model_training.ipynb` to train the machine learning models on the dataset.

3. **Generating Reports**:
   - The `report_generation.ipynb` notebook can be used to generate detailed reports based on the analysis.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizations are provided in the `visualizations/` directory to help you understand key trends and patterns.
